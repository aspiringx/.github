# AspiringX - Relationships are Everything

## Group intro
This github organization is focused on software engineers, but is part of a
broader networking group on LinkedIn that connects devs, PMs, UX designers, and
adjacent roles. We welcome people of all experience levels, including people
seeking mentors as you try to break into one of these career paths and people
seeking to hire in these roles (recruiters, managers, directors, execs, etc.).

Mentors who may have began thinking we were "doing a favor" to help others
quickly found that we were learning as much as teaching. You don't know
something well until you can effectively teach it! Anyone who can teach something,
regardless of experience level, can be a mentor!

We're heavily based on Utah's Silicon Slopes, but welcome friends and colleages
we've worked with anywhere. We connect on our LinkedIn group. We collaborate
in our Discord server.

## This github org
In this github org and repos, we work on open source projects where people
can collaborate to build relationships, learn and share skills, and make our
projects public in hopes they can be good reference examples for
understanding/learning various popular technologies.

## How to participate
Sorry if it seems snobby and exclusive, but we're serious about
"Relationships are Everything". You need to be invited by someone you know.

If you want to start a connection, you can connect with any of our group
owners or mentors that choose to add their LinkedIn profile to this list.

We want to ensure you're a real person who doesn't just want to join our group
to sell viagra or some other weird thing.

## Creating repos
Members are free to create new repos for learning anything. Please provide a
good README file to introduce the repo AND leave notes about its status. Like
instructions to install and try it out.

If you were just playing around and don't plan to pursue it, please mark it as
dead or delete it when you're done.
